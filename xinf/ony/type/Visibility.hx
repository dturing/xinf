	Contrary to $xinf.ony.type.Display$, Visibility only
	applies to the one element in question, not it's children
	(although it is inherited). That means, e.g., 
	if a $xinf.ony.Group$ has visibility [Hidden], 
	any children that specify visibility [Visible] 
	will still be shown.

	The "collapse" value is currently not supported.
